Prevent spam signups by bots and lost customers in comment, registration, and contact forms using Email Checker's Email Verification Plugin.

== Description ==

Email Checker's Advanced email verification service completes a deep cleaning by performing an SMTP simulation test to check if the mailbox actually exists on the destination mail server for the best email validation accuracy.

Lets face it, people misspell their email address and are completely unaware of it, resulting in a delivery failure due to a bounce or maybe even a spam complaint. Furthermore, you also just lost a potential customer for your business! What is very interesting is most of these invalid email addresses are a result of a simple misspelled domain such as "hotmail.con", "gnail.com", or "yahoo.cmo". 

For example "jane@gmail.cmo" perfectly passes the [is_email()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_email) function, but does not really exist. Such addresses cannot escape Email Checker's email verification test, ensuring you do not lose any valuable leads due to typos, as well as preventing spam signups by bots and more.

Email Checker can verify email addresses by detecting and revising typos, invalid syntax, invalid domain DNS, invalid MX DNS, disposable addresses, role accounts, free email providers, frequent complainers, offensive words, spam traps, honey pots, blacklists, catchalls, greylistings, mailbox exists, mailbox full and mailbox does not exist.

This email validation plugin integrates perfectly with other major plugins such as Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms and any other plugins that use the is_email() function. This plugin will validate email addresses in real-time and notify the user immediately so they can change it before submitting.
